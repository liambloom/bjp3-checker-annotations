                        A well–formed Java program has
                        a main method with { and }
                        braces.
                        A System.out.println statement
                        has ( and ) and usually a
                        String that starts and ends
                        with a " character.
                        (But we type \" instead!)

                        What is the difference between
                        a ' and a "? Or between a " and a \"?

                        One is what we see when we're typing our program.
                        The other is what appears on the "console."

                        A "quoted" String is
                        'much' better if you learn
                        the rules of "escape sequences."
                        Also, "" represents an empty String.
                        Don't forget: use \" instead of " !
                        '' is not the same as "

                        There was an old lady who swallowed a fly
                        I don’t know why she swallowed the fly
                        Perhaps she’ll die
                        But it’s only a fly
                        I think I’ll cry
                        She gulped it out of the sky
                        Oh, my!

                        There was an old lady who swallowed a spider
                        That wiggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.
                        She swallowed the spider to catch the fly
                        I don’t know why
                        She swallowed the fly
                        Perhaps she’ll die.
                        Gone to the by and by
                        Sigh

                        There was an old lady who swallowed a bird.
                        How absurd! She swallowed a bird!
                        She swallowed the bird to catch the spider.
                        She swallowed the spider to catch the fly
                        I don’t know why
                        She swallowed the fly
                        Perhaps she’ll die.
                        She’ll leave us high and dry.

                        There was an old lady who swallowed a cat.
                        Imagine that! She swallowed a cat.
                        She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.
                        She swallowed the bird to catch the spider.
                        She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.
                        I don’t know why
                        She swallowed the fly
                        Perhaps she’ll die.
                        I hope it’s a lie.

                        There was an old lady who swallowed a dog.
                        She went whole hog to swallow the dog.
                        She swallowed the dog to catch the cat.
                        She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.
                        She swallowed the bird to catch the spider.
                        She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.
                        I don’t know why
                        She swallowed the fly
                        Perhaps she’ll die.
                        There’s a tear in my eye.

                        There was an old lady who swallowed a cow.
                        I don’t know how she swallowed the cow.
                        She swallowed the cow to catch the dog.
                        She swallowed the dog to catch the cat.
                        She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.
                        She swallowed the bird to catch the spider.
                        She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.
                        I don’t know why
                        She swallowed the fly
                        Perhaps she’ll die.
                        I’d rather have ham on rye.
                        And she had a frog on the sly.
                        She did it in one try.

                        There was an old lady who swallowed a horse.
                        She died, of course.
                        It was the last course.
                        I’m filled with remorse.
                        What’s left to say...
                        Even the artist is crying.
                        We’ll miss her dearly.
                        It is such a loss.
                        She had no time to floss.
                        She missed out on the sauce.

                        Moral: Never swallow a horse.

                        This is the house that Jack built.

                        This is the malt
                        That lay in the house that Jack built.

                        This is the rat,
                        That ate the malt
                        That lay in the house that Jack built.

                        This is the cow with the crumpled horn,

                        This is the maiden all forlorn
                        That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,
                        That tossed the dog,
                        That worried the cat,
                        That killed the rat,
                        That ate the malt
                        That lay in the house that Jack built.

                        I once wrote a program that wouldn't compile
                        I don't know why it wouldn't compile,
                        My TA just smiled.

                        My program did nothing
                        So I started typing.
                        I added System.out.println("I &lt;3 coding"),
                        I don't know why it wouldn't compile,
                        My TA just smiled.

                        "Parse error," cried the compiler
                        Luckily I'm such a code baller.
                        I added a backslash to escape the quotes,
                        I added System.out.println("I &lt;3 coding"),
                        I don't know why it wouldn't compile,
                        My TA just smiled.

                        Now the compiler wanted an identifier
                        And I thought the situation was getting dire.
                        I added a main method with its String[] args,
                        I added a backslash to escape the quotes,
                        I added System.out.println("I &lt;3 coding"),
                        I don't know why it wouldn't compile,
                        My TA just smiled.

                        Java complained it expected an enum
                        Boy, these computers really are dumb!
                        I added a public class and called it Scum,
                        I added a main method with its String[] args,
                        I added a backslash to escape the quotes,
                        I added System.out.println("I &lt;3 coding"),
                        I don't know why it wouldn't compile,
                        My TA just smiled.
